gitconnector
======================================================================


Responsibilities / Goals
--------------------------------------------------
Ordered after prio:

- Central repo adheres to dragon guidelines.

- Simple and easy standart use cases

  - refine local state so it is 'nice' and thus pushable to central repo

  - push to central repo

  - pull from central repo

  - all that for 'main' branch

- Local repo can be anything. The point of DVCS is to locally do whatever you like.

  - However git dragon is only required to be able to work with a set of predefined states 

  - Engineers should be allowed any git tool/frontend they like

- Must remain minimalistic, simple. We cannot afford to build yet another cool
  git front end. Git offers loads of features, gitconnector can't even cover a
  small subset of them. We should define a standart front end like tortoise or
  smart-git, which then also appears in our own howtos. Some of the not anymore
  very basic workflows, but still standard/common workflows, like
  creating/switching multiple lokal branches, using the index, using the stash,
  should not be done with gitconnector.

- We don't have the (HW) infrastructure to do expensive compile test on the
  central server side. Thus the compile test must remain, as with
  vssconnector, on the client side.

- Does not undertake countermeassures against 'malicous' co-workers - we don't
  have them. If somebody really want's to circumvent the checks he can do it
  anyway.

Beside the 'ensure guidelines' thing, vssconnector was needed because vss is so
bad. gitconnector is needed because git offers so many workflows, the average
user might be overhelmed at the beginning - gitconnector shall give an easy to
use minimalistic abstraction of git's huge feature set.


.sln Problematic
--------------------------------------------------

.sln files are logically not needed. However final builder seems to need them.
Furthermore, MS Studio seems to always change some funny 'hash' values within
this file, altough no change to the solution was made. Thus: Because of final
builder, .sln files need to be in the git repo. Because of MS Studio's changes
to the .sln, we will always have merge conflicts if the .sln are in the repo.
Possible solutions

1) Put the .sln in a say ``./guesel/myproject.sln``. Nobody except final builer
   uses that file. A new build step in final builder would copy the file from
   ``./guesel/`` to ``./`` prior to actually building the solution.

2) git commit hook could always undo the changes MS Visual studio does. The
   characteristics of MS Studios automatic changes are known, so we can
   distinguis them from intended changes by the user. However maybe that will
   crash MS Studio because it doesn't like if one changes it's files behind it's
   back.


gitconnector commands
--------------------------------------------------

The basic commandos are release, commit, pull, make-nice.

release does almost everything together:

- commit any local changes

- pull

  - fetch

  - merge free branch

  - rebase nice branch

- make nice = merge-squash free onto nice

- push nice branch

.. Always on top level: commit
